2 task - Sort and Search

The task is getting complicated. You must create a program that generates an array of random numbers. Then the array of numbers is sorted by one of the stable sorting algorithms (at the studentâ€™s choice). After that, the program should find the desired number specified by the user in the sorted array by the binary search algorithm.
