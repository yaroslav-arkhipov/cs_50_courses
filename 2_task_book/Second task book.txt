1 task - First words of names

Write a program that asks for the username (using the GetString function, we get the name as a string) and then displays the first letters of the name (or names) and last name in uppercase without spaces, periods or other characters, only with a newline (\ n). We assume that users enter only letters (in lower or upper case, or both at once) plus one space between words. Consider guys named Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Conan O’Brien or David J. Malan not using the program.

2 task - Ave Caesar

Write a program that encrypts the entered string using Caesar's cipher.
Job parsing:

1. Get a key
2. Get text
3. Encrypt
4. Display encrypted message

3 task - Parlez-vous français?

Vizhener's cipher is somewhat safer than Caesar's cipher: it uses a word as a key and is difficult to crack manually using frequency analysis or brute force alone. Each letter of the key generates a number, and as a result we get several several keys for shifting letters.
