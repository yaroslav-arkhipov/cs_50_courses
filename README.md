In this repository, I will complete the course assignments. Tasks will be written in the Delphi programming language. All tasks are implemented in the IDE RAD Studio 10.3 Rio. If you wish, everyone can download and run the lesson he needs. Tasks are broken down by week for each week in the folder there is a description of the tasks in a separate text file. No additional dependencies are required, everything will be implemented using standard Delphi tools.
